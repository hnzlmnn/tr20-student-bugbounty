                        FishBowl Russia focuses heavily on <strong>security</strong> to provide
                        the best and most <strong>secure</strong> services to our <strong>customers</strong>.
                        We appreciate any effort put into making the world a safer place.
                        To support security researchers all around the world who follow the same goals,
                        we launched our official bug bounty program.
                    </p>
                    <h6>What is a bug bounty program?</h6>
                    <p>
                        A bug bounty program is an opportunity for everyone interested in identifying and reporting
                        security flaws in our applications and infrastructure.
                        In our <strong>open</strong> bug bounty program noone needs to register before testing.
                        The only limitation is the scope defined <a href="scope.html">here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Do you take submissions serious?</h6>
                    <p>
                        Knowing the security business quite well, we understand the difficulties of such programs.
                        We <strong>guarantee</strong> you, that every submission will be <strong>reviewed</strong> by a <strong>qualified</strong> employee.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Why should I help you?</h6>
                    <p>
                        Our drive for making the world a safer place motivates us to not only develop the best security appliance on the market
                        but to give back as much as we can to the community of security researchers.
                        We support all kinds of projects to research security solutions.
                    </p>
                    <h6>What's in it for me?</h6>
                    <p>
                        All submissions will be validated by a qualified member of our bug bounty administration team.
                        Everyone on the team has many years of experience in all fields of IT security.
                        We appreciate every submission.
                        That's why every submitter will get an appropriate reward for valid submissions.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Are there any special rules?</h6>
                    <p>
                        We want to keep the testing as realistic as possible.
                        Therefore, we strictly limit the scope of the bug bounty so you can <strong>intensively examine</strong>
                        every little bit within the scope.
                    </p>
                    <h6>How will I get notified when my submission was reviewed?</h6>
                    <p>
                        As mentioned earlier, there is no need for registration.
                        Our three-headed code monkey on crack found a solution to this.
                        Once you submit a finding you will receive an encrypted verification of your submission.
                        You can then use the verification to include it in your submission for the <strong>TROOPERS</strong>
                        student <a target="_blank" href="https://troopers.de/students/">motivational letter</a>.
                        Once your submission was reviewed we will inform our agents within the <strong>TROOPERS</strong>
                        organization team to prioritize your application.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Who is eligible for a reward?</h6>
                    <p>
                        As <strong>TROOPERS</strong> only accepts valid students for the student program, we will not
                        accept non-student submissions to the program.
                        (Non-student submissions are still welcomed via <a target="_blank" href="mailto:submission@fshbwl.ru">e-mail</a>)
                    </p>
